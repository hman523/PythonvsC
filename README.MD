Welcome to my software!
This code is less for actual use and more for comparing the run times of python and C.  
This code falls under the GPL v.3 permission set.  Use it responsibly.

Surprise surprise C ran faster.  While it did run faster, it was much slower to type and create.  It is also much less modular.  The python code was modified from a program I already had while the C code I had to write entirely for this.

By the way the file names are somewhat a misnomer.  I found that the C code was running so fast that the time it took was zero seconds.  This is unmeasurable so I rewrote it to generate more primes.  The results on run time can be found in results.txt

Thanks for checking this out.  if you ever run into me and think this code is cool, tell me.  I'd love to hear what you think.
